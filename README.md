# Movies Application  

This application is built using React, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. 
It displays a bunch of movies with the ability for the user to add reviews and watch trailers.

To run locally, 

1) Run the java spring boot application in the backend folder, or run the jar file using java -jar 'target/movies-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'
2) Run the frontend react code by going into the frontend/movie-gold-v1 folder and running npm start 

and thats it!

I have also hosted the backend on AWS Elasticbeanstalk here (http://spring-boot-movies-env.eba-m3pppaav.ca-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
and hosted the frontend on vercel here (https://react-springboot-movies-application-qgkf.vercel.app/)

So, you can go to the frontend website and see it running there as well. However, to make API calls successfully, you will need to go into the site settings and allow insecure content, as the API is not hosted on HTTPS.
